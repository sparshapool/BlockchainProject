Problem Statement - To build a decentralized PAN Card Verification System using Blockchain and Zero Knowledge Proofs, enabling secure, tamper-proof, and privacy-preserving identity verification for smart cities and IoT networks.
There is a growing need for a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof method to verify and store PAN card dataâ€”especially in the digital age where document forgery and identity theft are on the rise.
Also whenever a user needs to upload the personal details for KYC in the banks the data might be at risk. So, there is a need of blockchain to keep the details secure and hidden.

Proposed Solution - We propose a blockchain-integrated platform that uses:
- Smart Contracts to verify identity securely
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized file storage
- Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for validating data without revealing sensitive details
Once the user uploads his/her PAN Card and it gets verified using otp, contract address will get generated and user can take the same contract address to the bank or any legal authorities to get the profile verified without even submitting the details.
